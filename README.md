# 🛠️ Developer Setup Guide (Read Me First!)

Welcome to the team! Since this is your first time using Unity and GitHub, I wrote this guide to help you get started without any headaches. 

Please follow these steps exactly to avoid broken files or errors.

### 🛑 Important: Do NOT use "Download ZIP"
If you download the ZIP from this page, all game assets will be broken (1KB files) due to Git LFS. **Please follow the instructions below to Clone the project.**

---

## 🛠️ Step 1: Install Necessary Tools

Before downloading the project, you need two things installed:

1.  **GitHub Desktop** (Recommended)
    * Download here: [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/)
    * *Why? It handles all the complex file syncing for you.*

2.  **Unity Hub & Editor**
    * Download Unity Hub: [unity.com/download](https://unity.com/download)
    * **⚠️ Important:** Install Unity Version **[Please Enter Your Version Here]** (e.g., 2022.3.10f1).
    * *Note: You must use the exact same version as me, otherwise the project might not open.*

---

## 📥 Step 2: Download the Project

**✅ Correct Way to Download:**
1.  Open **GitHub Desktop**.
2.  Go to `File` -> `Clone repository...`
3.  Select this repository (`Element-Crush`) from the list.
4.  Click **Clone**.
5.  **Check:** If the download takes a while (loading >100MB), you are doing it right! If it finishes instantly (in 2 seconds), something is wrong.

---

## 🚀 Step 3: Open in Unity

1.  Open **Unity Hub**.
2.  Click the **"Add"** button.
3.  Select the folder you just downloaded with GitHub Desktop.
4.  Click the project name to open it.
    * *Note: The first time you open it, Unity needs to import library files. It might take 5-10 minutes. Please be patient!*

---

## 🎬 Step 4: How to See the Game (Crucial!)

When Unity finally opens, **the screen might look empty or just blue.** Don't panic! You haven't loaded the level yet.

**To see the game:**
1.  Look at the **"Project"** panel at the bottom of the screen.
2.  Find the folder: `Assets` -> `Scenes`.
3.  **Double-click** the scene file (e.g., `Main` or `SampleScene`).

🎉 Now you should see the game world in the center view!

---

## 💾 Step 5: How to Save & Sync

We are working together, so here is the workflow:

**1. Play Test:**
* Click the ▶️ **Play** button at the top to test the game. Click it again to stop.

**2. Save Your Work:**
* Press `Ctrl + S` (or `Cmd + S` on Mac) inside Unity to save the scene.

**3. Send Changes to Me:**
* Open **GitHub Desktop**.
* You will see a list of files you changed.
* Type a short summary in the bottom left box (e.g., "Fixed the player speed").
* Click **Commit to main**.
* Click **Push origin** (top right button).

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

* **Red Errors in Console?**
    * If they are yellow warnings, ignore them. If they are red errors preventing the game from playing, send me a screenshot.
* **Purple/Pink Objects?**
    * This means textures are missing (usually a download issue). Let me know immediately.

Happy Coding! 🚀
